## Future Scope

1. **Claim Limits**:

   - Implement limits on the number of claims per user to prevent abuse.

2. **Airdrop Scheduling**:

   - Introduce functionality to schedule airdrops at specific times or intervals.

3. **Token Cap**:

   - Set a maximum cap on the total number of tokens that can be airdropped.

4. **Airdrop Management**:

   - Allow owners to deactivate or adjust the airdrop schedule.

5. **Verification Mechanisms**:

   - Add user verification steps or conditions for claiming airdropped tokens.

6. **Multi-Token Support**:

   - Enable support for distributing multiple types of tokens in one airdrop.

7. **Tracking and Reporting**:
   - Implement tracking features to monitor airdrop distribution and usage statistics.

The **Airdrop Scheduler** contract simplifies the process of distributing tokens to users, enhancing engagement and token distribution strategies on the Aptos blockchain.
